## Professional Summary:

With 6 years of experience, I've excelled in designing, developing, and testing web-based and client-server applications using Java/J2EE. Proficient in SDLC methodologies (Waterfall, Agile, SCRUM, TDD), I've designed applications using J2EE patterns, coordinated with global teams, and developed with technologies like Servlets, JSP, JDBC, EJB, JMS, SOAP, and REST.
<br /> 
Expert in Spring framework, I've implemented IOC and configured application context. Used code review tools like HP Fortify, FindBugs, and developed data models with ORM frameworks. Leveraging Spring Boot and Hibernate, I created server-side applications, integrating WebLogic MQ JMS for communication.
<br /> 
My skills extend to web front-end development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Angular. I've worked with application servers (JBOSS, WebLogic) and version control tools (SVN, CVS, GIT). Proficient in back-end programming (SQL, PL/SQL), I use tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ, TOAD, and SOAP UI. A motivated team player, I possess strong communication, analytical, and problem-solving skills, staying passionate about learning new technologies and industry developments.
